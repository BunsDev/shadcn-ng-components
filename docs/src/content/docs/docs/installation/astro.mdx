<Steps>

1.  ### Create project

    Start by creating a new Astro project:

    ```bash
    npm create astro@latest
    ```

2.  ### Configure your Astro project

    You will be asked a few questions to configure your project:

    ```txt showLineNumbers
    - Where should we create your new project?
    ./your-app-name
    - How would you like to start your new project?
    Choose a starter template (or Empty)
    - Install dependencies?
    Yes
    - Do you plan to write TypeScript?
    Yes
    - How strict should TypeScript be?
    Strict
    - Initialize a new git repository? (optional)
    Yes/No
    ```

3.  ### Add Angular to your project

    Install Angular using the Astro CLI:

    ```bash
    npx astro add @analogjs/astro-angular
    ```

    <Aside class="mt-4">
      Answer `Yes` to all the question prompted by the CLI when installing

    </Aside>

4.  ### Add Tailwind CSS to your project

    Install Tailwind CSS using the Astro CLI:

    ```bash
    npx astro add tailwind
    ```

    <Aside class="mt-4">
      Answer `Yes` to all the question prompted by the CLI when installing
      Tailwind CSS.
    </Aside>

5.  ### Edit tsconfig.json file

    Add the following code to the `tsconfig.json` file to resolve paths:

    ```json showLineNumbers
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": ".",
        "paths": {
          "@/*": ["./src/*"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

6.  ### Run the CLI

    Run the `shadcn-ng` init command to setup your project:

    ```bash
    npx shadcn-ng@latest init
    ```

7.  ### Configure components.json

    You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

    ```txt showLineNumbers
    Which style would you like to use? › Default
    Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
    Where is your global CSS file? › ./src/styles/globals.css
    Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
    Where is your tailwind.config.js located? › tailwind.config.mjs
    Configure the import alias for components: › @/components
    Configure the import alias for utils: › @/lib/utils
    ```

8.  ### Import the globals.css file

    Import the `globals.css` file in the `src/pages/index.astro` file:

    ```astro showLineNumbers
    ---
    import '@/styles/globals.css'
    ---
    ```

9.  ### Update astro tailwind config

    To prevent serving the Tailwind base styles twice, we need to tell Astro not to apply the base styles, since we already include them in our own `globals.css` file. To do this, set the `applyBaseStyles` config option for the tailwind plugin in `astro.config.mjs` to `false`.

    ```ts showLineNumbers
    export default defineConfig({
      integrations: [
        tailwind({
          applyBaseStyles: false,
        }),
      ],
    });
    ```

10. ### Update tailwind.config.mjs

    When running `npx shadcn-ng@latest init`, your tailwind config for content will be overwritten. To fix this, change the `module.exports` to `export default` and the `content` section with the code below to your `tailwind.config.mjs` file:

    ```js showLineNumbers
    export default {
      content: ["./src/**/*.{astro,html,js,jsx,md,mdx,svelte,ts,tsx,vue}"],
    };
    ```

</Steps>
