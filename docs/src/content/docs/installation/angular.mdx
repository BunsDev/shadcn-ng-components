description: Install and configure Angular.
---

<Steps>

<Step>
### Create project
</Step>

Start by creating a new App using the Angular CLI.

```bash
ng new my-app
```

<Step>
### Add Tailwind and its configuration
</Step>

Install `tailwindcss` and its peer dependencies, then generate your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

npx tailwindcss init
```

<Step>
### Edit tsconfig.json file
</Step>

```json {3-6} showLineNumbers
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": ".",
        "paths": {
            "@/*": ["./src/*"]
        }
    }
}
```

<Step>
### Run the CLI
</Step>

Run the `shadcn-ng` init command to setup your project:

```bash
npx shadcn-ng@latest init
```

<Step>
### Configure components.json
</Step>

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Where is your global CSS file? › src/style.css
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
Where is your tailwind.config.js located? › tailwind.config.js
Configure the import alias for components: › @/components
Configure the import alias for utils: › @/lib/utils
```

<Step>
### That's it
</Step>

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```ts {2,7}
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { UbButtonDirective } from "@/components/ui/button.directive";

@Component({
    standalone: true,
    imports: [UbButtonDirective],
    template: `<button ubButton>Button</button>`,
})
export class ButtonDemoComponent {}
```

</Steps>
